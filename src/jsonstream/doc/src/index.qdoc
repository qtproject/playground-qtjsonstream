\title JSON Stream Reference
\page index.html

\section1 Introduction

QML and Javascript programs often need a way of communicating with a
server on the same machine or different machines.  There are many
protocols available, but the easiest for
Javascript-based programming languages is to use \l
{http://www.json.org} {JSON} data-interchange format.
The JSON Stream classes implement a client/server framework.

\section1 Interfaces

Conceptually, the JSON Stream classes are divided into a generic client (JsonClient),
a generic server (JsonServer), a stream transport shared by the client and the server (JsonStream),
and an optional authentication agent (JsonAuthority) which can be installed on the server.
Each connection to the JsonServer is given a unique \e{identifier} so that the different
connections can be disambiguated.

When a new socket connection is opened to the server, the authentication agent "absorbs" all
communication over that socket until the connection has been properly authenticated.
The authentication agent is also responsible for setting the \e{identifier} of the connection.
For example, an authentication agent that matches the process ID (PID) of the connecting
client to an appropriate user and permission writes may set the \e{identifier} of the
connection to the Unix name of the UID of the connecting process.
